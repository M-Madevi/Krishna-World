  <h3>üë∂ Janma Leela (Divine Birth)</h3>
  <p>Born in Mathura and miraculously carried to Gokul through the flooded Yamuna.</p>
  <p class="muted">Symbolism: The Divine appears to end darkness and fear.</p>

  <button class="full-story-btn" onclick="toggleStory(this)">Full Story</button>
     
  <div class="full-story">
  <strong> The birth of Lord Krishna symbolizes the arrival of divine light to dispel darkness and restore dharma.</strong>
  
  <p>
    On the dark, stormy night of <strong>Ashtami</strong> in the month of <em>Shravana</em>, Mathura lay under the cruel shadow of King Kamsa. 
    In the royal prison, Devaki and Vasudeva awaited the birth of their child ‚Äî the one destined to end tyranny. 
    The air was thick with anticipation, and outside, rain poured as though the heavens themselves knew the Divine was about to descend.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the stroke of midnight, a sudden stillness fell. A divine glow filled the prison cell, and in that sacred moment, 
    the Supreme Lord took form ‚Äî adorned with a golden crown, lotus eyes, and a radiant smile. Four arms held the 
    <em>Shankha</em> (conch), <em>Chakra</em> (discus), <em>Gada</em> (mace), and <em>Padma</em> (lotus). 
    The fragrance of heavenly flowers filled the air, and celestial music echoed from realms unseen.
  </p>
  <p>
    Devaki, with tears streaming down her cheeks, folded her hands in awe. Vasudeva bowed, his heart overwhelmed with reverence and love. 
    The Lord spoke gently: ‚ÄúI have come to protect the righteous, destroy evil, and restore dharma. 
    Take me to Gokul, to the house of Nanda and Yashoda, where I will grow among the cowherds.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    As if obeying the will of the Divine, the prison doors unlocked, chains fell from Vasudeva‚Äôs hands, 
    and the guards fell into a deep sleep. Carrying the newborn in a basket upon his head, Vasudeva stepped into the raging night. 
    The Yamuna, swollen with rain, parted her waters to grant him safe passage. Sheshanaga, the mighty serpent, spread his hoods 
    above to shield the baby from the storm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reaching Gokul, Vasudeva placed the divine child beside the sleeping Yashoda and took her newborn daughter in return. 
    By dawn, the exchange was complete, and the cosmic plan had begun. In this way, the Lord of the Universe arrived quietly 
    in the humble home of cowherds, ready to fill Vrindavan with His leelas and the world with His grace.

  <h3>üë©‚Äçüçº Yashoda Darshan Leela</h3>
  <p>Mother Yashoda sees the universe in Krishna‚Äôs mouth.</p>
  <p class="muted">Symbolism: The infinite divine is present in the child.</p>

  <button class="full-story-btn" onclick="toggleStory(this)">Full Story</button>
    <div class="full-story">
  <strong> This leela reveals that the Supreme Lord contains all creation within Himself, even while appearing as a simple child.</strong>

  <p>
    One bright afternoon in Vrindavan, little Krishna was playing with His friends on the soft banks of the Yamuna. 
    Laughter and giggles filled the air as the children ran through the green pastures. Suddenly, some boys ran to Mother Yashoda, 
    alarmed and out of breath.
  </p>
  <p>
    ‚ÄúMaiya! Krishna has eaten mud!‚Äù they cried. Yashoda was concerned and hurried to the spot. There He stood ‚Äî the darling of her heart ‚Äî 
    with dust on His cheeks and a mischievous sparkle in His eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
    ‚ÄúKrishna! Did you eat mud?‚Äù she asked firmly. Krishna, shaking His head, replied innocently, ‚ÄúNo, Maiya, I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù  
    But His friends insisted, ‚ÄúYes, Maiya, He did!‚Äù Yashoda decided to find out the truth herself.
  </p>
  <p>
    ‚ÄúOpen your mouth, Kanha,‚Äù she said. Krishna obeyed, parting His lips to reveal not mud ‚Äî but an astonishing sight.  
    Inside His tiny mouth, Yashoda saw the entire universe ‚Äî all planets, stars, oceans, mountains, the sun, moon, and even the land of Vrindavan itself.  
    She saw the cosmic creation in its entirety, swirling in divine harmony. She saw herself holding Him, inside His mouth, in a mysterious endless loop.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overwhelmed and trembling, Yashoda closed her eyes for a moment. When she opened them again, Krishna stood before her,  
    just her little boy, smiling sweetly as though nothing had happened.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yashoda‚Äôs motherly affection quickly returned, and she hugged Him tightly, choosing to forget the divine vision.  
    For her, He was not the Lord of all worlds ‚Äî He was her beloved son, her Kanha, the playful cowherd of Vrindavan.

  <h3>üßà Makhan Chor Leela</h3>
  <p>Stealing butter from Gopis‚Äô homes.</p>
  <p class="muted">Symbolism: Divine playfulness and sweetness of Krishna.</p>

  <button class="full-story-btn" onclick="toggleStory(this)">Full Story</button>

  <div class="full-story">
  <strong>This leela reveals Krishna‚Äôs mischievous nature and His divine playfulness, teaching devotion and joy through simplicity.</strong>

  <p>
    In the quaint village of Vrindavan, the sun shone brightly over mud huts and grazing cows. 
    Little Krishna, full of energy and curiosity, had a particular fondness for butter ‚Äî the creamy, golden delight that the Gopis stored in earthen pots. 
    Today, He decided to satisfy His sweet craving.
  </p>
  <p>
    Creeping silently through the narrow lanes, Krishna peeked into each home. 
    He spotted pots of freshly churned butter hung high on hooks, just out of reach of ordinary children. 
    With a mischievous grin, He called His friends, and together they devised clever ways to reach the treasure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Balancing expertly on rooftops and climbing trees, Krishna carefully grabbed the pots. 
    Occasionally, a Gopi noticed the theft and tried to chase Him, but the tiny cowherd eluded capture, laughing all the while.  
    Butter smeared on His cheeks, He delighted in sharing some with His friends and eating the rest Himself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once, Mother Yashoda saw the children sneaking back with smeared hands and sticky faces. 
    ‚ÄúKrishna! What have you done now?‚Äù she exclaimed. Krishna, with a twinkle in His eye, looked innocent and tried to hide the evidence.  
    Yashoda laughed, realizing that no punishment could curb the divine mischief of her little son.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Gopis, though initially annoyed, soon forgave Him, for they sensed that this playful act was more than childish fun.  
    It was a glimpse of the Supreme‚Äôs joy manifesting in human form.  
    Through these butter-stealing adventures, Krishna taught that devotion and love bring sweetness into life, just as butter sweetens the tongue.

  <h3>üëò Gopika Vastra Haran Leela</h3>
  <p>Hiding the clothes of Gopis while they bathe in the Yamuna.</p>
  <p class="muted">Symbolism: Divine play teaches humility and devotion.</p>

  <button class="full-story-btn" onclick="toggleStory(this)">Full Story</button>
<div class="full-story">
  <strong>This leela reveals Krishna‚Äôs playful divine mischief and the intimate love between Him and the Gopis, symbolizing the soul‚Äôs longing for the Divine.</strong>

  <p>
    On a bright morning in Vrindavan, the Gopis went to bathe in the cool, flowing waters of the Yamuna. 
    Their colorful clothes, neatly folded, were left on the riverbank as they entered the water, laughing and singing devotional songs to Krishna.
  </p>
  <p>
    Little Krishna, ever mischievous, watched from behind the trees. His eyes sparkled with delight as He saw the swaying garments, vibrant with colors and embroidery. 
    Quietly, He tiptoed toward the riverbank and, with a swift hand, gathered the clothes and climbed a nearby tree.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the Gopis returned, they gasped in shock. ‚ÄúOur clothes! Who has taken them?‚Äù they cried, trying to cover themselves.  
    Krishna, perched high on the tree, laughed joyfully, teasing them: ‚ÄúCome and take them, if you can!‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    The Gopis, initially embarrassed, soon realized the playful lesson in Krishna‚Äôs act. 
    Their laughter echoed along the river as they tried to coax Krishna down, singing songs of love and devotion. 
    Krishna, enjoying the playful exchange, finally returned the garments, satisfied with their heartfelt songs.
  </p>
  <p>
    This leela is not mere mischief; it represents the soul‚Äôs surrender and the Divine‚Äôs playful call to devotion.  
    Just as the Gopis sought Krishna to regain their clothes, the heart seeks the Lord to regain its own divine fulfillment.  
    In Vrindavan, these playful acts of Krishna became timeless symbols of love, devotion, and joy.

  <h3>ü©∏ Putana Vadha Leela</h3>
  <p>Killing the demoness Putana.</p>
  <p class="muted">Symbolism: Triumph of divine innocence over evil.</p>

  <button class="full-story-btn" onclick="toggleStory(this)">Full Story</button>
<div class="full-story">
  <strong>This leela reveals Krishna‚Äôs divine power and protection, even in infancy, demonstrating the victory of good over evil.</strong>

  <p>
    In the dark corridors of Mathura, the demoness Putana, sent by King Kamsa, disguised herself as a beautiful woman. 
    Her plan was to kill the infant Krishna by breastfeeding Him with poisoned milk. 
    She crept into the house of Yashoda under the cover of night, her eyes glowing with malice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Little Krishna, though just a few months old, sensed her evil intentions. 
    With a calmness that belied His tiny form, He allowed her to hold Him, smiling innocently.  
    As Putana brought her poisoned breast to His lips, Krishna opened His divine mouth and sucked the life out of the demoness instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    Putana‚Äôs strength failed, and her body fell lifeless to the floor, leaving the room filled with a strange aura of peace.  
    The poison could not harm Krishna, for He is the Supreme Protector of all righteous souls.  
    Yashoda, horrified and trembling, held her child close, realizing that even the fiercest demons could not harm Him.
  </p>
  <p>
    This leela symbolizes the divine assurance that evil will never triumph over the righteous, and that God‚Äôs power protects His devotees, even in their most vulnerable forms.  
    From this moment, Krishna‚Äôs fame as the destroyer of evil began to spread throughout Vrindavan and beyond.

  <strong>This leela demonstrates Krishna‚Äôs divine strength and courage, protecting Vrindavan from evil forces that threaten peace.</strong>

  <p>
    In the lively village of Vrindavan, the children were playing near the fields when suddenly, a huge cart demon named Shakatasura appeared. 
    The demon, with a monstrous form and terrifying eyes, rolled through the village streets, threatening to crush anyone in its path. 
    Panic spread among the villagers as cows and children ran for safety.
  </p>
  <p>
    Little Krishna, seeing the danger, calmly walked toward the cart. With His friends watching in awe, He lifted His tiny arms and struck the cart with immense force.  
    The demon cart trembled, twisted, and finally broke apart with a deafening crash. Pieces of the cart flew in all directions, scattering the demon‚Äôs power.
  </p>
  <p>
    The villagers, initially frozen in fear, cheered as Krishna, smiling innocently, comforted them. 
    His strength was not just physical but divine, showing that the Supreme Lord can destroy evil effortlessly, even while appearing as a playful child.
  </p>
  <p>
    This leela reminds devotees that no matter how overwhelming the danger, the divine always protects the righteous and restores peace and harmony in the world.  
    Shakatasura‚Äôs defeat became another testament to Krishna‚Äôs role as the protector of Vrindavan and all living beings.

<div class="full-story">
  <strong>This leela shows Krishna‚Äôs divine protection and strength, defeating even the most terrifying natural and supernatural forces.</strong>

  <p>
    One day in Vrindavan, a mighty whirlwind demon named Trinavarta descended from the skies, sent by King Kamsa to destroy Krishna.  
    The demon took the form of a powerful spinning wind, sweeping everything in its path ‚Äî huts, trees, and frightened villagers alike.
  </p>
  <p>
    Krishna, playing near the banks of the Yamuna, noticed the chaos. Without fear, He stood calmly as the whirlwind approached.  
    The demon tried to lift Him into the storm, thinking that a mere child could not resist its fury. But Krishna‚Äôs divine strength was infinite.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a gentle yet powerful gesture, Krishna allowed Himself to be lifted and then, using His small but mighty hands, pressed against the spinning demon.  
    The whirlwind lost its force, twisted uncontrollably, and eventually collapsed, vanishing into the earth.  
    Krishna landed safely, smiling, while the villagers, who had been watching in terror, erupted in joy and relief.
  </p>
  <p>
    This leela symbolizes that no matter how powerful or chaotic evil may seem, the divine always protects the innocent.  
    Trinavarta‚Äôs defeat reaffirmed Krishna‚Äôs role as the supreme protector, even as a small child in Vrindavan.
