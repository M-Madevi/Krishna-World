  <h1>🌸 Radha-Krishna: Eternal Love 🌸</h1></br>

  <p>Radha is the devoted soul. Krishna is the divine consciousness. Together, they represent the union of love and divinity.</p>

  <h5>❝ Radha's love was silent, Krishna's answer was eternal.❞</br>
  ❝ Radha's name comes before Krishna's — even the divine bows to devotion.❞</br>
  ❝ Their love wasn't told in words, it was felt in every breath of Vrindavan.❞</br>
  ❝ In every flute tune, there is a whisper of Radha's longing.❞</h5>

  <p>The love of Radha and Krishna transcends time, body, and ego. It is the symbol of pure bhakti-surrender, union, and joy.</p></br>
<h2>🦜 In the Wings of Devotion – The Parrot’s Tale</h2></br>
<p>
  In the celestial realm of Vrindavan, where the sweet melodies of Krishna’s flute echo through the trees, a divine parrot named "Shuka" (शुक) became a silent witness and messenger of Radha and Krishna's eternal love.</br></br>
  Shuka, whose name means “parrot” in Sanskrit, was no ordinary bird. Born with a divine purpose, he was a gift from nature to Radha, entrusted with the task of delivering love messages, secrets, and emotions between Radha and Krishna. His feathers shimmered with the hues of devotion — deep green, golden-tipped wings, and eyes filled with divine awareness.</br></br>
  Every morning, as Radha prepared to meet Krishna by the Yamuna or under the Kadamba trees, Shuka would fly ahead, announcing her arrival with joyful chirps and reciting Krishna’s name. And when Krishna was away, it was Shuka who carried Radha’s words, her sighs, her songs to him — sitting on his shoulder, whispering in his ear.</br></br>
  Sometimes, Shuka would mimic Krishna’s flute tunes, making Radha smile through her longing. He was also said to have listened to many divine leelas, absorbing the Bhagavata wisdom, which is why Shuka later became associated with Sage Shuka, the son of Vyasa, who narrated the Srimad Bhagavatam.</br></br>
But in Vrindavan, Shuka the parrot was more than a bird — he was the soul of longing, love, and devotion, fluttering between the hearts of the divine couple, ensuring their bond stayed alive in every moment, even in separation.</p></br>
<p style="color: #2fb555; font-size:20px;font-style: italic;">💫 Shuka, the divine parrot, symbolizes the voice of love and devotion, carrying the soul's deepest emotions between Radha and Krishna.</p>

<h4>
  🕊️ Shuka – The Divine Parrot of Love, Longing, and Devotion
</h4>
<p>❝ Welcome to a divine space where love sings in every leaf, and devotion dances with the wind. Inspired by Shuka, the sacred parrot of Vrindavan, we carry the timeless messages of Radha and Krishna's eternal love — pure, selfless, and divine.

Like Shuka, who whispered Radha's sighs into Krishna's heart and echoed the flute’s melody through the groves of Vrindavan, we exist to share beauty, wisdom, and bhakti. Each word, each creation here is crafted to reflect the joy of union, the sweetness of longing, and the peace of surrender.

Through stories, visuals, and sounds of the divine, our mission is simple —
To bring a little Vrindavan into your heart.❞</p></br>
