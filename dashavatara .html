      <h2>🐟 1. Matsya Avatar – The Fish Incarnation</h2>


      <p class="section-title">🔶 Purpose of Incarnation:</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">To protect the Vedas</span> and <span class="highlight">save humanity</span> during the <span class="highlight">Great Deluge</span> (Mahapralaya), ensuring the knowledge and seeds of life are preserved for the next era.</p>

      <p class="section-title">📜 Complete Story:</p>
      <p>In the <span class="highlight">Satya Yuga</span>, a <span class="highlight">great deluge</span> was destined to engulf the Earth. A demon named <span class="highlight">Hayagriva</span> stole the <span class="highlight">Vedas</span> and hid them deep in the ocean, threatening cosmic balance.</p>
      <p>One day, King <span class="highlight">Satyavrata</span> (later known as Manu) was offering water on a riverbank. A <span class="highlight">tiny fish</span> begged for help. The kind king placed it in a jar, but it rapidly grew until it needed the ocean.</p>
      <p>The fish revealed itself as <span class="highlight">Lord Vishnu</span> and warned the king of the coming flood. He was told to build a <span class="highlight">massive boat</span> and gather <span class="highlight">seven sages (Saptarishis)</span>, <span class="highlight">plant seeds</span>, and <span class="highlight">animal pairs</span>.</p>
      <p>As the flood came, Vishnu in the form of a <span class="highlight">gigantic fish</span> used <span class="highlight">Serpent Vasuki</span> as a rope to tow the ark safely. Vishnu also defeated <span class="highlight">Hayagriva</span> and restored the <span class="highlight">sacred Vedas</span>.</p>

      <h2>🐢 2. Kurma Avatar – The Tortoise Incarnation</h2>
      <p class="section-title">🔶 Purpose of Incarnation:</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">To support Mount Mandara</span> during the <span class="highlight">Samudra Manthan</span> (churning of the cosmic ocean) and help retrieve <span class="highlight">divine treasures</span> including <span class="highlight">Amrit</span> (nectar of immortality).</p>

      <p class="section-title">📜 Complete Story:</p>
      <p>The <span class="highlight">Devas (gods)</span> lost their strength due to a curse and needed the <span class="highlight">Amrit</span> to regain it. But they could only get it by churning the <span class="highlight">Ocean of Milk</span>. For this, they formed a truce with the <span class="highlight">Asuras (demons)</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Mount Mandara</span> was chosen as the churning rod and <span class="highlight">Serpent Vasuki</span> as the rope. However, the mountain began to sink into the ocean due to its immense weight.</p>
      <p>To save the mission, <span class="highlight">Lord Vishnu</span> took the form of a <span class="highlight">giant tortoise (Kurma)</span> and held the mountain on his back. This allowed the churning to continue smoothly.</p>
      <p>As the churning went on, many treasures emerged—<span class="highlight">Kamadhenu</span>, <span class="highlight">Airavata</span>, <span class="highlight">Lakshmi</span>, <span class="highlight">Kalpavriksha</span>, and finally the <span class="highlight">pot of Amrit</span>.</p>
      <p>To prevent the Asuras from getting the nectar, Vishnu took another form—<span class="highlight">Mohini</span>, a beautiful enchantress—who cleverly distributed the <span class="highlight">Amrit</span> only to the Devas.</p>

        <li><strong>Mohini (Vishnu)</strong> – Form taken to outwit the demons</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="section-title">🌈 Emotions & Values:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Support</strong> – Holding up burdens silently like the tortoise</li>
        <li><strong>Teamwork</strong> – Cooperation between good and evil for higher goals</li>
        <li><strong>Wisdom</strong> – Using intelligence over brute force</li>
        <li><strong>Deception for Good</strong> – Sometimes illusion protects dharma</li>
